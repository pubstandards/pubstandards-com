	<h1>About Pub Standards</h1>
	<p>Started in 2005 and taking place on the middle Thursday of every month,
    Pub Standards is a casual meet-up in a friendly pub or bar for those who
    work, or are interested in, the web industry.</p>
	<h2>Who’s it for?</h2>
	<p>Loosely aimed at web design / development / programming dogsbodies, that
	 doesn’t mean you have to fit into those categories and it doesn’t mean chitchat need necessarily be web-related. Don’t expect structure, don’t expect presentations, just relax with likeminded people.</p>
	<h2>Where’s it at?</h2>
	<p>Currently there are chapters in <a href="http://london.pubstandards.com/">London</a>, <a href="http://pubstandards.ie/">Dublin</a>, and San Francisco. Visit their own sites for more details.</p>
	<p>If none of these locations are especially convenient, it might be a wildly brilliant idea to <a href="/newchapter">start your own chapter</a>.</p>	
	<h2>Upcoming, Mailing List and <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></h2>
	<p>To keep abreast of the latest events, fun facts, and inane ramblings, sign up to <a href="http://lists.pubstandards.co.uk/listinfo.cgi/beer-pubstandards.co.uk">the mailing list</a> or head over to the IRC channel (<code>#pubstandards</code> on irc.freenode.net). When someone can be arsed, meet-ups will be thrown <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/">on Upcoming</a>.</p>
	<h2>Substandards</h2>
	<p>The mid-Pub Standards non-Pub Standards Pub Standards. For the more hardcore, Substandards takes place on the middle Thursday between regular Pub Standards’.</p>
	<p>The rules are that, instead of having a number (like regular Pub Standards) it must have a name (such as Substandards Suspenders) and must always be in a different pub. Keep an eye on Upcoming or the mailing list for details, or to add suggestions for names or locations.</p>
